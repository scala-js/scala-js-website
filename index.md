Scala.js compiles Scala code to JavaScript, allowing you to write your web application entirely in Scala! Take a look at the [project gallery](#built_with_scalajs) to see what kind of things you can build with Scala.js.

## Get started

<span><a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/doc/tutorial.html" class="btn btn-large btn-success">Start the Tutorial</a></span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span><a href="http://www.scala-js-fiddle.com/" class="btn btn-large btn-success">Try it in the Browser</a></span>

The easiest way to get started is to follow our [tutorial](./doc/tutorial.html). You can also fork the
[bootstrapping skeleton](https://github.com/sjrd/scala-js-example-app)
and follow the instructions in its readme or [try it out in the browser](http://www.scala-js-fiddle.com/). There's also an e-book [Hands-on Scala.js](https://lihaoyi.github.io/hands-on-scala-js) which contains a lot of introductory material to help you get started.

We also have a [standalone distribution](./downloads.html) that doesn't require SBT.

_Note that Scala.js is not part of the Typesafe Reactive platform.
Thus, although we consider Scala.js production-ready, Typesafe does not provide any commercial support for it._


## Noteworthy features

*   Support all of Scala (including macros!),
    modulo [a few semantic differences](./doc/semantics.html)
*   Very good [interoperability with JavaScript code](./doc/js-interoperability.html).
    For example, use jQuery and HTML5 from your Scala.js code, either in a
    typed or untyped way. Or create Scala.js objects and call their methods
    from JavaScript.
*   [Integrated with sbt](./doc/sbt-plugin.html)
    (including support for dependency management and incremental compilation)
*   Can be used with your favorite IDE for Scala
*   Generates [Source Maps](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/)
    for a smooth debugging experience (step through your Scala code from within
    your browser supporting source maps)
*   Integrates [Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/)
    for producing minimal code for production. Compiled blobs range from 170-400kb
*   Produces (very) efficient JavaScript code
    ([benchmarks](https://github.com/sjrd/scalajs-benchmarks))

## Libraries

This is a collection of libraries known to work with Scala.js.
Some of them, like `scala-js-dom` and `scala-js-jquery`, are specific to Javascript and don't make sense on the JVM.
Some others, such as `scala-async`, are pure-macro projects, and thus work with Scala.js out of the box.
Most of them, though, are cross-compiling over JVM and JS, and thus have separate artifacts to run on each platform.

If you have a library that would be useful to the Scala.js community, please
[add it to this list](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-website/edit/master/index.md)!
Add a new entry for the library under the appropriate category below, press "Propose file change"
and then "Create a Pull Request".
