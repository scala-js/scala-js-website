title: Integrate JavaScript libraries with ScalablyTyped
---

In this third tutorial, we learn how to integrate JavaScript libraries with [ScalablyTyped](https://scalablytyped.org/).

We start here with the project developed in the previous tutorial about [UI development with Laminar](./laminar.html).
To follow along this tutorial, either use the result of the previous tutorial, or checkout [the laminar-end-state branch](https://github.com/sjrd/scalajs-sbt-vite-laminar-chartjs-example/tree/laminar-end-state) of the accompanying repo.

If you prefer to navigate the end result for this tutorial directly, checkout [the scalablytyped-end-state branch](https://github.com/sjrd/scalajs-sbt-vite-laminar-chartjs-example/tree/scalablytyped-end-state) instead.

There are no playgrounds in [Scribble](https://scribble.ninja/) for this tutorial because it does not support ScalablyTyped.
You will need a local project to follow along.

## Prerequisites

Make sure to install [the prerequisites](./index.html#prerequisites) before continuing further.

## Set up ScalablyTyped with Chart.js

We will use [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), a JavaScript library, to draw a bar chart out of the shopping list data.
In order to get static types and bindings for Chart.js, we use [ScalablyTyped](https://scalablytyped.org/).
ScalablyTyped can read TypeScript type definition files and produce corresponding [Scala.js facade types](/doc/interoperability/facade-types.html).

We set up our new dependencies as follows.

First, we install some npm packages: Chart.js as a regular dependency (with `-S`), and its TypeScript type definitions along with the TypeScript compiler---required by ScalablyTyped---as development dependencies (with `-D`):

{% highlight shell %}
$ npm install -S chart.js@2.9.4
...
$ npm install -D @types/chart.js@2.9.29 typescript@4.9.5
...
{% endhighlight %}

In `project/plugins.sbt`, we add a dependency on ScalablyTyped:

{% highlight scala %}
addSbtPlugin("org.scalablytyped.converter" % "sbt-converter" % "1.0.0-beta41")
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, in `build.sbt`, we configure ScalablyTyped on our project:

{% highlight diff %}
 lazy val livechart = project.in(file("."))
   .enablePlugins(ScalaJSPlugin) // Enable the Scala.js plugin in this project
+  .enablePlugins(ScalablyTypedConverterExternalNpmPlugin)
   .settings(
     scalaVersion := "3.2.2",
     [...]
     // Testing framework
     libraryDependencies += "org.scalameta" %%% "munit" % "0.7.29" % Test,
+
+    // Tell ScalablyTyped that we manage `npm install` ourselves
+    externalNpm := baseDirectory.value,
   )
{% endhighlight %}

For these changes to take effect, we have to perform the following steps:

1. Restart sbt and the `~fastLinkJS` task (this will take a while the first time, as ScalablyTyped performs its magic)
1. Restart `npm run dev` if it was running
1. Possibly re-import the project in your IDE of choice

## Chart configuration

We can now enjoy Chart.js with static types in our Scala.js code.

First, we define the Chart.js configuration that we will use:

{% highlight scala %}
  val chartConfig =
    import typings.chartJs.mod.*
    new ChartConfiguration {
      `type` = ChartType.bar
      data = new ChartData {
        datasets = js.Array(
          new ChartDataSets {
            label = "Price"
            borderWidth = 1
            backgroundColor = "green"
          },
          new ChartDataSets {
            label = "Full price"
            borderWidth = 1
            backgroundColor = "blue"
          }
        )
      }
      options = new ChartOptions {
        scales = new ChartScales {
          yAxes = js.Array(new CommonAxe {
            ticks = new TickOptions {
              beginAtZero = true
            }
          })
        }
      }
    }
  end chartConfig
{% endhighlight %}

At the top, we import the facade types for Chart.js generated by ScalablyTyped:

{% highlight scala %}
import typings.chartJs.mod.*
{% endhighlight %}

This gives us access to types like `ChartConfiguration` and `ChartType`.

Inside the `ChartConfiguration`, we provide a number of Chart.js-related options to make our chart look the way we want:

* the type of chart as a bar chart: `type = ChartType.bar`,
* two datasets with the labels `"Price"` and `"Full price"`, respectively, and
* the `y` axis' start value as `0`.

All of these configuration options are type-checked, using the static types provided by ScalablyTyped.
If written in JavaScript, the above configuration would read as:

{% highlight javascript %}
{
  type: "bar",
  data: {
    datasets: [
      {
        label: "Price",
        borderWidth: 1,
        backgroundColor: "green"
      },
      {
        label: "Full price",
        borderWidth: 1,
        backgroundColor: "blue"
      }
    ]
  },
  options: {
    scales: {
      yAxes: [{
        ticks: {
          beginAtZero: true
        }
      }]
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

In a sense, that is all there is to know about ScalablyTyped.
What follows is more about the integration of a third-party "component" into Laminar than anything else.

## Rendering the chart

We now amend our `appElement()` method to also call a new `renderDataChart()` function:

{% highlight diff %}
  def appElement(): Element =
     div(
       h1("Live Chart"),
       renderDataTable(),
+      renderDataChart(),
       renderDataList(),
     )
   end appElement
{% endhighlight %}

The implementation of `renderDataChart()` is rather large.
We show it in its entirety first, then we will pick it apart.

{% highlight scala %}
  def renderDataChart(): Element =
    import scala.scalajs.js.JSConverters.*
    import typings.chartJs.mod.*

    var optChart: Option[Chart] = None

    canvas(
      // Regular properties of the canvas
      width := "100%",
      height := "200px",

      // onMountUnmount callback to bridge the Laminar world and the Chart.js world
      onMountUnmountCallback(
        // on mount, create the `Chart` instance and store it in optChart
        mount = { nodeCtx =>
          val domCanvas: dom.HTMLCanvasElement = nodeCtx.thisNode.ref
          val chart = Chart.apply.newInstance2(domCanvas, chartConfig)
          optChart = Some(chart)
        },
        // on unmount, destroy the `Chart` instance
        unmount = { thisNode =>
          for (chart <- optChart)
            chart.destroy()
          optChart = None
        }
      ),

      // Bridge the FRP world of dataSignal to the imperative world of the `chart.data`
      dataSignal --> { data =>
        for (chart <- optChart) {
          chart.data.labels = data.map(_.label).toJSArray
          chart.data.datasets.get(0).data = data.map(_.price).toJSArray
          chart.data.datasets.get(1).data = data.map(_.fullPrice).toJSArray
          chart.update()
        }
      },
    )
  end renderDataChart
{% endhighlight %}

We create a Laminar `canvas()` element.
We give it a `width` and `height` using Laminar's `:=`, as we did before.

For its actual content, we want Chart.js to take over.
For that, we have to create an instance of `Chart` referencing the DOM `HTMLCanvasElement`.
In order to bridge the world of Laminar `Element`s and Chart.js, we use `onMountUnmountCallback`.

That function takes one callback executed when the element is attached to a DOM tree, and one when it is removed.
When the element is mounted, we want to create the instance of `Chart`.
When it is unmounted, we want to call the `destroy()` method of Chart.js to release its resources.

The `mount` callback receives a `nodeCtx`, which, among other things, gives us a handle to the underlying `HTMLCanvasElement`.
We name it `domCanvas`, and use it together with the `chartConfig` defined above to create an instance of Chart.js' `Chart` class:

{% highlight scala %}
val domCanvas: dom.HTMLCanvasElement = nodeCtx.thisNode.ref
val chart = Chart.apply.newInstance2(domCanvas, chartConfig)
{% endhighlight %}

We store the resulting `chart` instance in a local `var optChart: Option[Chart]`.
We will use it later to update the `chart`'s imperative data model when our FRP `dataSignal` changes.

In order to achieve that, we use a `dataSignal -->` binder.
We give it as an argument to the Laminar `canvas` element to tie the binder to the canvas lifetime, as you may [recall from the Laminar tutorial](laminar.html#editing-prices).
Once the `canvas` gets mounted, every time the value of `dataSignal` changes, the callback is executed.

{% highlight scala %}
dataSignal --> { data =>
  for (chart <- optChart) {
    chart.data.labels = data.map(_.label).toJSArray
    chart.data.datasets.get(0).data = data.map(_.price).toJSArray
    chart.data.datasets.get(1).data = data.map(_.fullPrice).toJSArray
    chart.update()
  }
},
{% endhighlight %}

In the callback, we get access to the `chart: Chart` instance and update its data model.
This `-->` binder allows to bridge the FRP world of `dataSignal` with the imperative world of Chart.js.

Our application now properly renders the data model as a chart.
When we add or remove data items, the chart is automatically updated, thanks to the connection established by the `dataSignal -->` binder.

## Conclusion

That concludes our tutorial on ScalablyTyped.

We saw how to configure ScalablyTyped to get static types for external JavaScript libraries, and how to integrate a third-party component into a Laminar model.
