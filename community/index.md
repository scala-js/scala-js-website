Scala.js started as an experimental compiler project but it has since matured to a full ecosystem with a lot of
enthusiastic developers writing libraries, facades for JS libs, tutorials and documentation.

## Built with Scala.js

Following web applications are built with Scala.js

- [Seventh Sense](https://7thsense.io), predictive analytics for sales and marketing. Scala.js+react components used inside legacy angular application.
- [Querki](https://www.querki.net/help/#Learning-Querki), a cloud-based system for small-scale data management
- [MF Metabolic Analyzer](https://www.metabolicanalyzer.com) is a system to help physicians interpret and draw conclusions from cardiopulmonary exercise tests.
- [Insightware](https://insightware.com/), a next-generation A/B testing tool. All of the dashboard is built with Scaja.js.
- [Stofftante](https://www.stofftante.ch), web store for fabrics
- [NetLogo Web](http://netlogoweb.org/launch), an agent-based simulation language. (only the NetLogo-to-JavaScript compiler is
  written in Scala, not the front end)
- [MiniJava compiler](http://oxnrtr.de/mj) which originally targeted amd64, but received an AST interpreter to run in the browser.
